# RockPaperScissorsTOP

<h1>Rock-Paper-Scissors Game</h1>
    <h4>Version 0:</h4>
    <p>- Started laying out basic logic of the game in JS using only console for now.</p>
    <p><em>Idea: </em> Expand the game to The big Bang Theory's version called Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock</p>

<h4>Version 0.03</h4>
    <p>- Finished with game logic<br>
        - Added game loop<br>
        - Set end condition to 5 wins (TOP says to play just 5 rounds)<br>
        - Added welcome and endgame messages<br>
        - Added score counters<br>
    </p>

<h4>v0.04 Rock/Paper/Scissors/Lizard/Spock</h4>

<p>- Expanded the game to include Lizard and Spock<br>
- Moved win logic to outer function to make code a bit cleaner<br>
</p>

        - Worked on my debugging skills<br>
